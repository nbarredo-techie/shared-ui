### 2. Resolved Build Issues
- ✅ Updated TypeScript from v4.3.5 to v5.8.3 to support modern features like `WeakKey`
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript configuration with ES2022 support
- ✅ Added `skipLibCheck: true` to avoid third-party type issues

- ✅ Updated eslint-config-prettier from v8.3.0 to v9.0.0
- ✅ Updated eslint-plugin-prettier from v3.4.1 to v5.0.0
- ✅ Updated Prettier from v2.8.8 to v3.0.0
- ✅ Updated pretty-quick from v3.3.1 to v4.1.1
- ✅ All peer dependency warnings resolved

### 4. Code Formatting
- ✅ Ran Prettier across entire codebase to fix formatting issues
- ✅ All ESLint errors resolved
- ✅ Consistent code style maintained

## Current Exports

Your `@terraboost/shared-ui` library now exports:

```tsx
// Theme components
export { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from '@terraboost/shared-ui';
export { ThemeToggle } from '@terraboost/shared-ui';

// UI components (including dependencies for ThemeToggle)
export { Button, DropdownMenu, DropdownMenuContent, DropdownMenuItem, DropdownMenuTrigger } from '@terraboost/shared-ui';
// ... other UI components
```

## Usage in Microfrontends

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, ThemeToggle } from '@terraboost/shared-ui';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="system" storageKey="my-app-theme">
      <header>
        <div>My App</div>
        <ThemeToggle />
      </header>
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSING**
- ✅ ESLint: **PASSING** 
- ✅ Prettier: **PASSING**
- ✅ Webpack bundle: **PASSING**
- ✅ Tailwind CSS: **PASSING**
- ✅ Type definitions: **GENERATED**

## Ready for Production
Your theme system is now fully functional and ready to be consumed by your Single-SPA microfrontends!

### Note
The remaining deprecation warning about `util._extend` is from an older dependency (likely webpack) and doesn't affect functionality. It will be resolved when those dependencies update in future versions.
